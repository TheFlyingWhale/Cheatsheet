        <h3>What is CSS in JS?</h3>
        <p>CSS in JS allows you to write styles in JS which comes with both some positives and some negatives.</p>
        <p>
            An obvious advantage is that it's easier to get rid of code thats not being used. 
            <br>
            Writing components (for example) and writing the styles within the component document,
            its easy to just get rid of the components when you know that components isn't being used.
            By doing so you both delete the compoenent and the styles associated with that component.
