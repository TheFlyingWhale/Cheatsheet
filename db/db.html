    <h3>What is a Database?</h3>
    <p>In computing, a database is an organized collection of data stored and accessed electronically from a computer system. Where databases are more complex they are often developed using formal design and modeling techniques.</p>

    <h3>PostgreSQL Constraints</h3>

    <h4>Specifically, Constraints</h4>

    <ul>
        <li>Reject rows containing values that shouldn't be inserted into a database table, which can help with preserving data integrity and quality</li>
        <li>Raise an error when they're violated, which can also help with debugging applications that write to the database.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>There are quite a few types of constraints:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Data types - Are your first line of defense, these rules aren't constraints but can help reject incorrect data from your database</li>
        <li><code>NOT NULL</code> constraints - Reject incoming rows from your table when critical information is missing from a row.</li>
        <li><code>CHECK</code> constraints - Give you more control over what rules you'd like to apply to your tables. These constraints will allow you to reject a row if it fails the criteria you've defined</li>
        <li><code>PRIMARY KEY</code> constraints - A column or combination of columns that uniquely identify a row and are both <code>NOT NULL</code> and <code>UNIQUE</code>. <code>PRIMARY KEY</code>s are unique to a table, and will often be used in joins between tables</li>
        <li><code>FOREIGN KEY</code> constraints - Allow you to maintain <i>referential integrity</i> between two tables by validating the entry in one also appears in the other. Referential integrity depends on <code>FOREIGN KEY</code> constraints</li>
    </ul>
